# NIPS ML Paper Analysis

## How to run the project:
For running the ipynb file, using google colab would be enough.

## Project overview:
This project analyzes trends in machine learning research by examining data from papers presented at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference from 1987 to 2017. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data visualization techniques, this analysis identifies key topics and explores how the field has evolved over three decades.

## Dataset overview:
The dataset, papers.csv, includes NIPS conference papers from 1987 to 2017, with key columns like:

-Title: The paperâ€™s main focus.

-Abstract: Summary of each paper (if available).

-Year: Publication year, allowing trend analysis.

Additional metadata was removed to focus on titles and years for analyzing machine learning research trends over time.
